### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces. 

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

```javascript
const whatToDoForLunch = function(hungry, availableTime) {
  if (hungry === false) {
    return "wait until you're hungry!";
  } 
  else {
    if (availableTime <= 20) {
      return "pick something up and eat in back in the Lab or in the kitchen, where you can get to know your fellow classmates";
    }

    if (availableTime > 20 && availableTime < 30) {
      return "ou deserve a break and could try a place in Gastown";
    }

    if (availableTime > 30) {
      return "this is a bootcamp after all and you should probably reconsider";
    }
  }
}


/*
 * This is some test runner code that's simply calling our whatToDoForLunch function
 * defined above to verify we're making the right decisions. Do not modify it!
 */

console.log("I'm hungry and I have 20 minutes for lunch.");
console.log(whatToDoForLunch(true, 20));
console.log("---");

console.log("I'm hungry and I have 50 minutes for lunch.");
console.log(whatToDoForLunch(true, 50));
console.log("---");

console.log("I'm not hungry and I have 30 minutes for lunch.");
console.log(whatToDoForLunch(false, 30));
console.log("---");

console.log("I'm hungry and I have 15 minutes for lunch.");
console.log(whatToDoForLunch(true, 15));
```
